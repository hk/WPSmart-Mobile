WPSmart Mobile: Your blog, mobile ready...and beautiful

== Description ==

WPSmart Mobile automatically gets your WordPress blog mobile-ready with a beautiful theme that automatically adjusts depending on the device it's accessed on, whether it's an iPhone, Android, BlackBerry, or Windows.

Customize the design, enable ads, add analytics code quickly and easily from the admin panel.  Your current theme will still be shown when users access your site from a desktop, but on mobile devices they'll be shown a beautiful mobile-optimized theme instead, without you having to touch any code whatsoever.  The plugin comes with three unique themes built-in that are deeply customizable through your WordPress admin panel.

Have a question or are stuck?  Submit a question in the WordPress.org plugin support forum (http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/wpsmart-mobile) and we'll get back to you promptly!
